//The fundamental concepts in any programming language are values and references.
//In Java, Primitive variables store the actual values, whereas Non-Primitives store the reference variables
//which point to the addresses of the objects theyâ€™re referring to. Both values and references are stored in the stack memory.
//Arguments in Java are always passed-by-value. During method invocation, a copy of each argument,
//whether its a value or reference, is created in stack memory which is then passed to the method.
//In case of primitives, the value is simply copied inside stack memory which is then passed to the callee method;
//in case of non-primitives, a reference in stack memory points to the actual data which resides in the heap.
//When we pass an object, the reference in stack memory is copied and the new reference is passed to the method.
